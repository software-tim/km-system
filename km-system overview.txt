lets start simple so you can catch up. i am building a knowlege management system in    │
│   astro on azure, it uses fastapi. the ui is as web app called km-ui here is the          │
│   km-syustem/km-ui/index.astro file that supports the ui for uploading documents, and     │
│   viewing the results. the second layer is km-orchstrator located at                      │
│   km-system/km-orchestrator/index.astro . km-orchestrator connects to km-mcp-sql-docs,    │
│   km-mcp-llm, km-mcp-graphrag, km-mcp-search to get its results and then the             │
│   orchestrator returns the integrated results back to km-ui. km-ui/index.astro is the     │
│   home page, km-ui/upload/index.astro it the ui for uploading documents,                  │
│   km-ui/upload/results/index.astro is the ui to view the integrated results of a          │
│   document uploaded such as chunking, ai insights, graphrag insights, etc. my github      │
│   resource group is km-group and i use github to publish. km-ui has its own deployment    │
│   at km-system/km-ui/github/workflow, and all the other services are published from       │
│   km-system/github/workflow.
